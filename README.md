### Markdown

Markdown is a formatting language which is used to write content on this website. You can see some examples below or read this [Tutorial](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

```markdown
Paragraphs are just written in one line like that: Proin vel mollis elit. Sed aliquam, tellus lobortis aliquam tincidunt.

If you want to start a new paragraph, give it two more newlines (Return) and it will appear!

If you need to break with a newline at a special point\
use this backslash. Or the<br>
break HTML tag!
